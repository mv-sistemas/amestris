### Flags
| Name       | Shortcut | Description                               |
| :--------- | :------- | :-------------------------                |
| `template` | `-t`     | **Required**. Path to you template folder |
| `help`     | `-h`     | display help of cli                       |
| `help`     | `-v`     | display the version of cli                |

### Contraints and limitations
The template processing depends on the golang standard template package, thus some limitations are inherent to the package. Check the package documentation on https://pkg.go.dev/text/template. 

Besides that due some limitations we decide that in order to process variables of type array, we would expect that the variables of type array should end with `Array`. 

The same with camelcase notation, we would expect a variable that ends with `CamelCase` and also this variable should have a matching variable with the same name minus `CamelCase`, e.g. `Name` and `NameCamelCase`.
